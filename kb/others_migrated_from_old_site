#### 1. Ubuntu remove guest session

Edit `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` so that it looks like this:
```bash
greeter-session=unity-greeter
user-session=ubuntu
allow-guest=false
```
Thanks to: http://askubuntu.com/questions/62564/how-do-i-disable-the-guest-session

You can also remove the remote login by adding:
```bash
greeter-show-remote-login=false
```
