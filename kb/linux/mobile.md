I am getting more and more annoyed by the fact the Android (the OS that comes with my mobile devices) does not allow me to extend it's persistent storage, to install more apps. On a computer you add an extra disk and you can place anything you'd like on that disk. But on the original Android ( https://support.google.com/android/answer/12153449?hl=en ) you can format it as "portable", which means that you just want to move data from one device to another one. Or, format it as "internal" storage, which also allows you to (for example) install "some" apps on it. I say "some" apps, because not all apps can be installed on an SD card, that's something that the developer can chose not to support/allow. And, anyway, that's just the 2 options in the official Android. But if we talk about Samsung or Huawei, those are modified Android versions, with other changes/limits imposed. For example Samsung does not want to allow you to move apps to SD card, because SD cards are slow, any you'd get a poor performance. I see the point, but I need more flexibility. I'm not going to complain to Samsung, or any 3rd party, saying that Samsung is slow, because I've decided to move a specific app to the SD card. Anyway, I want the flexibility that I have on my desktop to be available on my mobile. So, I'm waiting for a true linux OS, an open OS.

While Ubuntu Touch seems to have a lot of funds, and growing, I'm also looking into Mobian ( a Debian for mobile devices ) - https://wiki.mobian.org/doku.php?id=install-android . Both of them seem to look into supporting Xiaomi devices.

I'm also looking into a "Grub" like solution for my mobile, which would let me choose the OS . Maybe this would help: https://github.com/Teamwin/android_bootable_recovery/ .
