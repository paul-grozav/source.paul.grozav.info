<p>“When I despair…I remember that all through history…the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers…and for a time, they can seem invincible…but in the end, they always fall.</p>
<p>Think of it.<br />
Always.” Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi</p>

<pre>“
  A university professor went to a Zen master, named Nan-in, to learn about Zen.
  Being polite, the master served the professor a cup of tea.
  As the master was making the tea, the professor began to show off his
    erudition, expounding on his knowledge of Zen.
  When the tea was made, the master began pouring the tea into the professor's
    cup. He went on pouring even after the cup was full, spilling the tea onto
    the table and then onto the lap of his visitor, until the professor cried:
    "Stop! My cup is full! No more will go in!".
    The master turned to the professor and said:
    "So is your mind. How can I teach you if your mind is so full of your own
    ideas?"
