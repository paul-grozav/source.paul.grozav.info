<h1>1. A unit of measure</h1><hr/>

Imagine that human civilization goes extinct. Billions of years later, an alien
civilization arrives to earth, looking for intelligent life signs. Maybe they
will find some text, containing a measurement of 100 meters. How will they know
how much space 100 meters is?

Let me tell you that the height of my body is 3.54 horse heads. Am I tall? You
know, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length" target="_blank">
horse</a> -
<a href="https://www.sportingindex.com/training-centre/winning-distances"
target="_blank">head</a>. It might make no sense if you are not familiar with
that measuring unit.

Anyone can define a measuring unit for any physical quantity. So for example
I could tell you that the height of my body is 27.31 PPD. Oh wait, you don't
know how much 1 PPD is - well, "Paul's Pupillary Distance" (or PPD for short)
is equal to 0.06224 meters.

So, you see, the numbers change a lot, if you change the definition of the unit.
So, let's define the units that we're going to use.






<hr/><a id="2._international_system_of_units" />
<h1>2. International System of Units</h1><hr/>
There are 7 base quantities and measurement units which form a basic set of
units from which all other units can be derived. (but no quantity in the set
should be expressed in terms of the others?)

Mathematically, the dimension of the quantity `Q` is given by:
$$ dim \ Q = L^a \cdot M^b \cdot T^c \cdot I^d \cdot {\Theta}^e \cdot N^f
  \cdot J^g $$
where `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g` are the dimensional exponents.


<hr/><a id="2.1._metre" />
<h2>2.1. Metre</h2><hr/>
Length is a measure of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance" target="_blank">distance</a>.
The `1 meter` length is used as an unit, to measure distance.

<br/>The historical origin (justification) for the value quantity of a meter is:

"<i>1 / 10 000 000 of the distance from the Earth's equator to the North Pole
measured on the median arc through Paris.</i>"

<br/>The post-2019 formal definition of a meter is:

"<i>The metre is currently defined as the length of the path travelled by light
in a vacuum in $$ \frac{1}{299\ 792\ 458} $$
 of a second.</i>"


<hr/><a id="2.2._kilogram" />
<h2>2.2. Kilogram</h2><hr/>
The `1 kilogram` unit is used to measure mass.

<br/>The historical origin (justification) for the value quantity of a kilogram
is:

"<i>The mass of one litre(one thousandth of a cubic metre = $$ \frac{1}{1000}
\cdot m^3 $$) of water at the temperature of melting ice.</i>"

<br/>The post-2019 formal definition of a kilogram is:

"<i>It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant" target="_blank">Planck
constant</a> $$ h $$ to be $$ 6.62607015 \cdot 10^{−34} $$ when expressed in
the unit $$ J \cdot s $$, which is equal to $$ kg \cdot m^2 \cdot s^{−1} $$,
where the metre and the second are defined in terms of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" target="_blank">c</a> and
$$ \Delta ν_{Cs} $$</i>"

<br/>The average mass of a new-born human baby is approximately
$$ 3.5 \cdot kg $$ .

<br/>**Note** that the **mass** of an object is a measure of the object's
inertial property, or the amount of matter it contains. The **weight** of an
object is a measure of the force exerted on the object by gravity, or the force
needed to support it. For example, your mass is the same no matter where you go
in the universe; your weight, on the other hand, changes from place to place.
Mass is measured in kilograms. Even though we usually talk about weight in
kilograms, strictly speaking it should be measured in <a href="#2.10._newton">
newtons</a>, the units of force.



<hr/><a id="2.3._second" />
<h2>2.3. Second</h2><hr/>
The `1 second` unit is used to measure how much time has elapsed.

<br/>The historical origin (justification) for the value quantity of a second
is:

"<i>The day was divided into 24 (parts, which we call hours), each hour was
divided in 60 (parts, which we call minutes) and each minute was divided in 60
(parts, which we call seconds).
A second is $$ \frac{1}{24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60} = \frac{1}{86400} $$ of the
day.</i>"

<br/>The post-2019 formal definition of a second is:

"<i>It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency
$$ \Delta ν_{Cs} $$, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency
of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit
$$ s ^ {-1} $$ (which is equal to Hz).</i>"


<hr/><a id="2.8._velocity" />
<h2>2.8. Velocity</h2><hr/>
Dimension: $$ L \cdot T^{-1} $$ . With a length dimension component and a time
dimension component.

Unit of measure: $$ m \cdot s^{-1} \Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{s} \Leftrightarrow
m/s $$ 

<br/>The velocity measures the rate of change of an object's position with
respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time.

The velocity is a vector. It has a scalar(magnitude) which is called speed and
a direction of movement(change in position).

<br/>For example a human is walking with a speed of approximately $$ 1.56 \cdot
\frac{m}{s} $$.

<br/>Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time. In equation
form that is:

$$ v = \frac{d}{t} $$
where $$ v $$ is the speed, $$ d $$ is distance, and $$ t $$ is time.

<hr/><a id="2.9._acceleration" />
<h2>2.9. Acceleration</h2><hr/>
Dimension: $$ L \cdot T^{-2} $$ . With a length dimension component and a time
dimension component.

Unit of measure: $$ m \cdot s^{-2} \Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{s^2} $$

<br/>Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with
respect to time.

<br/>The units "metre per second squared" can be understood as change in
velocity per time. For example an increase of velocity by 1 metre per second
every second.


<hr/><a id="2.10._newton" />
<h2>2.10. Newton</h2><hr/>
Dimension: $$ L \cdot M \cdot T^{-2} $$ . With a length dimension component, a
mass dimension component and a time dimension component.

Unit of measure: $$ 1 \cdot N = 1 \cdot \frac { kg \cdot m }{s^2} $$ 

One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of
one metre per second squared in the direction of the applied force.

<br/>At average gravity on Earth (conventionally, $$ g = 9.80665 \frac{m}{s^2}
$$), a 1 kilogram mass exerts a force of about $$ 9.8 $$ newtons. An
average-sized apple exerts about one newton of force, which we measure as the
apple's weight.

$$ 1 N = 0.10197 kg \cdot 9.80665 m \cdot s^{-2} $$ where ( $$ 0.10197 kg =
101.97 $$ grams, the average weight of an apple).

<br/>The weight of an average adult exerts a force of about $$ 608 N $$.

$$ 608 N = 62 kg \cdot 9.80665 m \cdot s^{-2} $$ (where $$ 62 kg $$ is the world
average adult mass).

<hr/><a id="2.11._joule" />
<h2>2.11. Joule</h2><hr/>
A Joule is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a
force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force's motion
through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or $$ N \cdot m $$).

<br/>It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one
ampere ( $$ 1 A $$ ) passes through a resistance of one ohm ( $$ 1 \Omega $$ )
for one second ( $$ 1 s $$ ).

<br/>**Practical examples** - One joule represents (approximately):

2.11.1. The kinetic energy of a $$ 2 kg $$ mass traveling at $$ 1 m/s $$

2.11.2. The energy required to lift a medium-sized tomato up 1 metre (assume the
tomato has a mass of approximately 100 grams).

2.11.3. The energy required to accelerate a $$ 1 kg $$ mass at $$ 1
\frac{m}{s^2} $$ through a distance of $$ 1 m $$.

2.11.4. The heat required to raise the temperature of $$ 1 g $$ of water by
$$ 0.24 °C $$.

2.11.5. The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every
$$ \frac{1}{60} \cdot s $$ (approximately $$ 17 ms $$).

2.11.6. The kinetic energy of a $$ 50 kg $$ human moving very slowly (at
$$ 0.2 m/s $$ or $$ 0.72 km/h $$).

2.11.7. The kinetic energy of a $$ 56 g $$ tennis ball moving at $$ 6 m/s $$
( $$ 22 km/h $$ ).

2.11.8. The amount of electricity required to light a $$ 1 W $$ LED for
$$ 1 s $$.

2.11.9. A kilowatt-hour is $$ 3.6 $$ megajoules.

<h1>3. Elementary particles</h1><hr/>
<hr/>
Humanity has noticed, along the time, that all everyday objects that can be
touched are made up of smaller objects, they are divisible.

<br/>With time, we've come up with a fancy word, and "all everyday objects that
can be touched" are called **matter**.

<br/>In a more formal way, matter can be defined as anything that has mass and
volume.

<br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus" target="_blank">
Democritus</a>, a Greek philosopher (born ~460 B.C.), wondered what would happen
if you cut a piece of matter, such as an apple, into smaller and smaller pieces.
He thought that a point would be reached where matter could not be cut into
still smaller pieces. He called these "uncuttable" pieces *a-tomos*
(in-divisible). This is where the modern term **atom** comes from.

As you can see, now we know that the atom **is** divisible and we are aware of
at least 3 distinct elements (the colored balls in the image above - the lines
are just trajectories):


- **Neutrons** - These are the **black** balls in the image. They have a big
mass but no electric charge(they are neutral).
- **Protons** - These are the **red** balls in the image. They have a big mass
and a positive electric charge.
- **Electrons** - These are the **blue** balls in the image. They have a small
mass and a negative electric charge.

<br/>It is only a convention that electric charge of the electron is *negative*
and the electric charge of the proton is *positive*.

<br/> The atomic **nucleus** is the small, dense region consisting of neutrons
and protons at the center of an atom. The nucleus is made of one or more protons
and a number of neutrons. Only the most common variety of hydrogen has no
neutrons.

<br/>More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The electron has a
mass that is approximately $$ 1/1836 $$ that of the proton. Protons and neutrons
have approximately the same mass of $$ 1.66053906660(50) \cdot 10^{−27} kg
= 1 Da $$, which is called 1 *Da*lton. Electrons have a mass of
$$ 9.1093837015(28) \cdot 10^{−31} kg $$.


<br/>Particles with the *same* electric charge(both positive or both negative),
when placed next to each other, will experience a force, they will repel each
other(they will try to move away from each other, to move in the opposite
direction, to maximize the distance between them).

<br/>Particles with *different* electric charge(a positive and a negative one),
when placed next to each other, will experience a force, they will attract each
other(they will both try to move closer together, towards the same point in
space, to minimize the distance between them).

<br/>If the number of protons and electrons are equal, then the atom is
electrically neutral. Ions are atoms that have an different number of electrons
than the number of protons, thus it has a positive or negative electric charge.
Note that only electrons can come inside an atom, and can leave the atom
structure!

<br/>Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers ($$ = 1 Å =
1^{-10} m $$) in diameter. The diameter of an electron is considered to be
$$ 2.8179403227(19) \cdot 10^{-15} m $$. The diameter of a proton is considered
to be $$ 1.682838 \cdot 10^{-15} m $$. The diameter of a neutron is considered
to be approximately $$ 1.6 \cdot 10^{-15} m $$. For some atoms, the diameter of
the nucleus is about 100 000 times smaller than the diameter of the atom.

<br/>However, the atoms are so small that accurately predicting their behavior
and studying some of their properties, using classical physics — as if they were
tennis balls, for example — is not possible due to quantum effects.

<br/>The **atomic number** is the number of protons inside an atom, and it helps
us identify the type of atom, in

list/table of atom types</a>.

1. Volts - measure the pressure. Pressure that pushes electrons through the circuit.
2. Amperes - measures how many electrons pass a certain point(section of wire) in a certain interval of time.

3. Is it true that increasing the pressure(volts), the amperes will also increase? If you put more pressure on a water pipe, more water drops(millilitres) will pass per time.

4. `Wats = Volts x Amperes` `W = V x A`
5. V(Voltage/Volts/Pressure), I(Intensity/Amperage/Flow), R(Resistance/Restriction_to_flow/Ohms/Ω) - `V = I * R` - Ohm's law. The voltage V in volts (V) is equal to the current I in amps (A) times the resistance R in ohms (Ω) . also known as $$ R = \frac{V}{I}  = ohms = \frac{volts}{amperes} $$
6. `P = V * I` = `watts = volts * amperes`
7. `1 Ampere = 1 Coulomb/second` where 1 [Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb) is = `6 241 509 074 460 762 607.776 elementary_charges` Note the `0.776` termination. That is less than 1 proton/electron which can not be created, thus it is impossible to realize exactly 1 C of charge. An elementary_charge is a proton(positive charge) or electron(negative charge). Thus `6 241 509 074 460 762 607.776 protons` = `+ 1 C` and `6 241 509 074 460 762 607.776 electrons` = `- 1 C`.
8. 1 Ampere_Hour = is the **amount of energy charge** in a battery that will allow 1 Ampere of current to flow for 1 Hour.

9. A typical alkaline or NiMH battery in the standard “AA” size has about 2000 to 3000 mAh (or 2 to 3 Ah)

From these 2 formulas: $$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$ and $$ P = V \cdot I $$ we can expand
to 12 formulas, expressing each of the 4 value as a combination of 2 of the
other 3 values.

So, we have:

2.1. $$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$ - that's how it is defined

2.2. $$ R = \frac{V^2}{P} $$ - Because ...

2.3. $$ R = \frac{P}{I^2} $$ - Because ...

2.4. $$ P = V \cdot I $$ - That's how it is defined

2.5. $$ P = I^2 \cdot R $$ - Because ...

2.6. $$ P = \frac{V^2}{R} $$ - Because ...

2.7. $$ V = I \cdot R $$ - Because ...

2.8. $$ V = \frac{P}{I} $$ - Because ...

2.9. $$ V = \sqrt{P \cdot R} $$ - Because ...

2.10. $$ I = \frac{V}{R} $$ - Because ...

2.11. $$ I = \frac{P}{V} $$ - Because ...

2.12. $$ I = \sqrt{\frac{P}{R}} $$ - Because ...
