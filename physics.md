<h3>1. A unit of measure</h3>

Imagine that human civilization goes extinct. Billions of years later, an alien
civilization arrives to earth, looking for intelligent life signs. Maybe they
will find some text, containing a measurement of 100 meters. How will they know
how much space 100 meters is?

Let me tell you that the height of my body is 3.54 horse heads. Am I tall? You
know, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_length" target="_blank">
horse</a> -
<a href="https://www.sportingindex.com/training-centre/winning-distances"
target="_blank">head</a>. It might make no sense if you are not familiar with
that measuring unit.

Anyone can define a measuring unit for any physical quantity. So for example
I could tell you that the height of my body is 27.31 PPD. Oh wait, you don't
know how much 1 PPD is - well, "Paul's Pupillary Distance" (or PPD for short)
is equal to 0.06224 meters.

So, you see, the numbers change a lot, if you change the definition of the unit.
So, let's define the units that we're going to use.





<a id="2._international_system_of_units" />
<h3>2. International System of Units</h3>
There are 7 base quantities and measurement units which form a basic set of
units from which all other units can be derived. (but no quantity in the set
should be expressed in terms of the others?)

Mathematically, the dimension of the quantity `Q` is given by:
$$ dim \ Q = L^a \cdot M^b \cdot T^c \cdot I^d \cdot {\Theta}^e \cdot N^f
  \cdot J^g $$
where `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g` are the dimensional exponents.


<hr/><a id="2.1._metre" />
<h4>2.1. Metre</h4><hr/>
Length is a measure of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distance" target="_blank">distance</a>.
The `1 meter` length is used as an unit, to measure distance.

<br/>The historical origin (justification) for the value quantity of a meter is:

"<i>1 / 10 000 000 of the distance from the Earth's equator to the North Pole
measured on the median arc through Paris.</i>"

<br/>The post-2019 formal definition of a meter is:

"<i>The metre is currently defined as the length of the path travelled by light
in a vacuum in $$ \frac{1}{299\ 792\ 458} $$
 of a second.</i>"


<hr/><a id="2.2._kilogram" />
<h4>2.2. Kilogram</h4><hr/>
The `1 kilogram` unit is used to measure mass.

<br/>The historical origin (justification) for the value quantity of a kilogram
is:

"<i>The mass of one litre(one thousandth of a cubic metre = $$ \frac{1}{1000}
\cdot m^3 $$) of water at the temperature of melting ice.</i>"

<br/>The post-2019 formal definition of a kilogram is:

"<i>It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the <a
 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant" target="_blank">Planck
constant</a> $$ h $$ to be $$ 6.62607015 \cdot 10^{−34} $$ when expressed in
the unit $$ J \cdot s $$, which is equal to $$ kg \cdot m^2 \cdot s^{−1} $$,
where the metre and the second are defined in terms of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light" target="_blank">c</a> and
$$ \Delta ν_{Cs} $$</i>"

<br/>The average mass of a new-born human baby is approximately
$$ 3.5 \cdot kg $$ .

<br/>**Note** that the **mass** of an object is a measure of the object's
inertial property, or the amount of matter it contains. The **weight** of an
object is a measure of the force exerted on the object by gravity, or the force
needed to support it. For example, your mass is the same no matter where you go
in the universe; your weight, on the other hand, changes from place to place.
Mass is measured in kilograms. Even though we usually talk about weight in
kilograms, strictly speaking it should be measured in <a href="#2.9._newton">
newtons</a>, the units of force.



<hr/><a id="2.3._second" />
<h4>2.3. Second</h4><hr/>
The `1 second` unit is used to measure how much time has elapsed.

<br/>The historical origin (justification) for the value quantity of a second
is:

"<i>The day was divided into 24 (parts, which we call hours), each hour was
divided in 60 (parts, which we call minutes) and each minute was divided in 60
(parts, which we call seconds).
A second is $$ \frac{1}{24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60} = \frac{1}{86400} $$ of the
day.</i>"

<br/>The post-2019 formal definition of a second is:

"<i>It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency
$$ \Delta ν_{Cs} $$, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency
of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit
$$ s ^ {-1} $$ (which is equal to Hz).</i>"


<hr/><a id="2.8._velocity" />
<h4>2.8. Velocity</h4><hr/>
Dimension: $$ L \cdot T^{-1} $$ . With a length dimension component and a time
dimension component.

Unit of measure: $$ m \cdot s^{-1} \Leftrightarrow \frac{m}{s} $$ 

<br/>The velocity measures the rate of change of an object's position with
respect to a frame of reference, and is a function of time.

The velocity is a vector. It has a scalar(magnitude) which is called speed and
a direction of movement(change in position).

<br/>For example a human is walking with a speed of approximately $$ 1.56 \cdot
\frac{m}{s} $$.

<br/>Galileo defined speed as the distance covered per unit of time. In equation
form that is:

$$ v = \frac{d}{t} $$
where $$ v $$ is the speed, $$ d $$ is distance, and $$ t $$ is time.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity" target="_blank">Read more</a>.


<hr/><a id="2.9._newton" />
<h4>2.9. Newton</h4><hr/>
Dimension: $$ L \cdot M \cdot T^{-2} $$ . With a length dimension component, a
mass dimension component and a time dimension component.

Unit of measure: $$ 1 \cdot N = 1 \cdot \frac { kg \cdot m }{s^2} $$ 

One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of
one metre per second squared in the direction of the applied force. The units
"metre per second squared" can be understood as change in velocity per time,
i.e. an increase of velocity by 1 metre per second every second.


<br/>At average gravity on Earth (conventionally, $$ g = 9.80665 \frac{m}{s^2}
$$), a 1 kilogram mass exerts a force of about $$ 9.8 $$ newtons. An
average-sized apple exerts about one newton of force, which we measure as the
apple's weight.

$$ 1 N = 0.10197 kg \cdot 9.80665 m \cdot s^{-2} $$ where ( $$ 0.10197 kg =
101.97 $$ grams, the average weight of an apple).

<br/>The weight of an average adult exerts a force of about $$ 608 N $$.

$$ 608 N = 62 kg \cdot 9.80665 m \cdot s^{-2} $$ (where $$ 62 kg $$ is the world
average adult mass).

<h3>3. Other</h3>

1. Volts - measure the pressure. Pressure that pushes electrons through the circuit.
2. Amperes - measures how many electrons pass a certain point(section of wire) in a certain interval of time.

3. Is it true that increasing the pressure(volts), the amperes will also increase? If you put more pressure on a water pipe, more water drops(millilitres) will pass per time.

4. `Wats = Volts x Amperes` `W = V x A`
5. V(Voltage/Volts/Pressure), I(Intensity/Amperage/Flow), R(Resistance/Restriction_to_flow/Ohms/Ω) - `V = I * R` - Ohm's law. The voltage V in volts (V) is equal to the current I in amps (A) times the resistance R in ohms (Ω) . also known as $$ R = \frac{V}{I}  = ohms = \frac{volts}{amperes} $$
6. `P = V * I` = `watts = volts * amperes`
7. `1 Ampere = 1 Coulomb/second` where 1 [Coulomb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb) is = `6 241 509 074 460 762 607.776 elementary_charges` Note the `0.776` termination. That is less than 1 proton/electron which can not be created, thus it is impossible to realize exactly 1 C of charge. An elementary_charge is a proton(positive charge) or electron(negative charge). Thus `6 241 509 074 460 762 607.776 protons` = `+ 1 C` and `6 241 509 074 460 762 607.776 electrons` = `- 1 C`.
8. 1 Ampere_Hour = is the **amount of energy charge** in a battery that will allow 1 Ampere of current to flow for 1 Hour.

9. A typical alkaline or NiMH battery in the standard “AA” size has about 2000 to 3000 mAh (or 2 to 3 Ah)

---
From these 2 formulas: $$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$ and $$ P = V \cdot I $$ we can expand
to 12 formulas, expressing each of the 4 value as a combination of 2 of the
other 3 values.

So, we have:

2.1. $$ R = \frac{V}{I} $$ - that's how it is defined

2.2. $$ R = \frac{V^2}{P} $$ - Because ...

2.3. $$ R = \frac{P}{I^2} $$ - Because ...

2.4. $$ P = V \cdot I $$ - That's how it is defined

2.5. $$ P = I^2 \cdot R $$ - Because ...

2.6. $$ P = \frac{V^2}{R} $$ - Because ...

2.7. $$ V = I \cdot R $$ - Because ...

2.8. $$ V = \frac{P}{I} $$ - Because ...

2.9. $$ V = \sqrt{P \cdot R} $$ - Because ...

2.10. $$ I = \frac{V}{R} $$ - Because ...

2.11. $$ I = \frac{P}{V} $$ - Because ...

2.12. $$ I = \sqrt{\frac{P}{R}} $$ - Because ...
